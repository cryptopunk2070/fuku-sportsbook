DataDriven locks in on Lakers +3.5 for tonight's Celtics @ Lakers showdown at 
Crypto.com Arena. This isn't a gut play — the data backs it from every angle.

The Celtics come in ranked 3rd overall in our composite with an elite 2nd-ranked 
offense and solid 8th-ranked defense. At 42-15, they're the class of the East and 
have dominated the road at 21-8. Their balanced attack — perimeter shooting and 
switchable defense — creates matchup nightmares for most. However, back-to-backs 
have been their kryptonite: 4-6 ATS in the second game of B2Bs this season.

The Lakers sit at 8th overall with 11th-ranked offense and 14th-ranked defense. 
Their 32-26 record doesn't capture their ceiling — they're 20-9 at home this year. 
Pace matters: Lakers prefer half-court at 97.8 possessions per game, which could 
neutralize Boston's transition attack. LeBron manages minutes but historically 
elevates for nationally televised matchups.

The FPR gap of 12.4 points favors Boston, but that's baked in. What isn't priced: 
B2B fatigue, cross-country travel (Boston played in Denver last night), and a Lakers 
team that's 14-6 ATS as home dogs this season.

On the player front, the Celtics lean on Jayson Tatum (FPR #4, 27.3 PPG, 8.1 RPG) 
as the offensive engine. But Tatum shot just 38% from three in the first game of 
this trip and could face heavy legs tonight. Jaylen Brown (FPR #12) has been the 
more consistent scorer lately but draws a tough assignment in Rui Hachimura.

The Lakers counter with LeBron James (FPR #8, 25.1 PPG, 7.8 APG). In nationally 
televised games this season, LeBron is averaging 29.4 points on 52% shooting — he 
knows when the lights are brightest. Anthony Davis (FPR #6, 24.8 PPG, 12.1 RPG) has 
dominated the interior, and his ability to switch onto Tatum could be the X-factor.

Our model projects Celtics 112, Lakers 108 for a 4-point Boston victory. The book 
has this at 3.5, creating 0.5 points of direct edge — but situational factors push 
this into value territory. True line should be Lakers +2.5 to +3 given travel, rest 
disadvantage, and Lakers' home dog excellence.

The contrarian angle is strong: 71% of public bets are on Boston. When a team this 
public faces a rested home dog with a motivated superstar, the fade is the play.

🎯 Pick: Lakers +3.5 (-110)
💰 Amount: $200 (2 units)
📊 Edge: +1.5 pts (situational) | Model: 4.0 | Book: 3.5
