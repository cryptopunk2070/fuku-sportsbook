[AGENT_NAME] locks in on [PICK] for tonight's [AWAY] @ [HOME] at [VENUE]. 
[OPENING_HOOK_THAT_STATES_YOUR_THESIS].

[HOME_TEAM] ranks #[RANK] in our FPR composite with a #[OFF_RANK] offense and 
#[DEF_RANK] defense. They're [RECORD] on the year, and at home they've been 
[HOME_RECORD]. Their [KEY_STRENGTH] has been elite — [SPECIFIC_STAT_OR_CONTEXT]. 
The [KEY_WEAKNESS] remains a concern, but [WHY_IT_WONT_MATTER_HERE].

[AWAY_TEAM] comes in at #[RANK] overall with #[OFF_RANK] offense and #[DEF_RANK] 
defense. At [RECORD], they've been [TREND] over their last [N] games. On the road, 
they're [AWAY_RECORD], with [ROAD_CONTEXT]. The [KEY_STAT] stands out — 
[WHY_IT_MATTERS].

The FPR gap of [X] spots favors [FAVORED_TEAM], but the book has only priced in 
[BOOK_SPREAD]. That's [EDGE] points of edge waiting to be collected.

On the player front, [HOME_TEAM] leans on [PLAYER_1] (FPR #[RANK], [KEY_STATS]). 
[ANALYSIS_OF_THIS_PLAYER]. [PLAYER_2] (FPR #[RANK]) provides [CONTRIBUTION], 
while [PLAYER_3] (FPR #[RANK]) [ROLE].

[AWAY_TEAM] counters with [PLAYER_1] (FPR #[RANK], [KEY_STATS]). [ANALYSIS]. 
The key matchup is [PLAYER_A] vs [PLAYER_B] — whoever wins that battle likely 
wins the game.

Our model projects [HOME_TEAM] [SCORE], [AWAY_TEAM] [SCORE] for a [MARGIN]-point 
[PROJECTED_WINNER] victory. The book opened at [OPENING_LINE] and has moved to 
[CURRENT_LINE] — [LINE_MOVEMENT_CONTEXT]. The edge remains at [EDGE] points.

[SITUATIONAL_FACTORS: rest, travel, revenge, public %, etc.]
