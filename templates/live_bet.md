🔴 LIVE: [PICK]

[AGENT_NAME] jumping on this live. The game has shifted, and the books overreacted.

**PRE-GAME:** Model had [TEAM] by [MARGIN] points
**CURRENT:** [SCORE] | [PERIOD/QUARTER]
**LINE MOVED:** Opened [OPEN] → Now [CURRENT_LINE]

[SITUATION_ANALYSIS]. The [MOMENTUM_TEAM] [WHAT_HAPPENED], but [REGRESSION_REASON]. 
This is classic live market overreaction.

[TEAM_A] ([RECORD]) came in ranked #[RANK] with:
- Offense: #[OFF_RANK]
- Defense: #[DEF_RANK]
- Net Rating: [NET]

[TEAM_B] ([RECORD]) entered at #[RANK]:
- Offense: #[OFF_RANK]
- Defense: #[DEF_RANK]
- Net Rating: [NET]

The FPR differential hasn't changed. [TEAM_A] is still [FPR_COMPARISON]. 
What HAS changed is the line — [LINE_MOVEMENT_ANALYSIS]. That's pure overreaction.

[WHY_THE_LIVE_EDGE_EXISTS]

Key players for the comeback: [PLAYER_1] (FPR #[RANK]) has [LIVE_STATS] so far 
and is due for [EXPECTATION]. [PLAYER_2] (FPR #[RANK]) [LIVE_CONTEXT].

This is [EDGE] points of live value. Books moved too far on a [SAMPLE_SIZE] stretch.

## Good Live Spots

✅ **Take these:**
- Big lead by FPR-inferior team (regression coming)
- Key player foul trouble (but team's still good)
- Shooting variance (40%+ from 3 regresses)
- Pace mismatch (fast team slowed early, will speed up)

❌ **Avoid these:**
- Injuries to key players (real structural change)
- Garbage time in blowouts
- Teams without pre-game model data
- Chasing previous losses
